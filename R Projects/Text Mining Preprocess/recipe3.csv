Heat the remaining half cup cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles form and it just begins to simmer. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Put 1 waffled cake on a cake stand or plate. Use an offset spatula to evenly spread a quarter cup of the raspberry-cream mixture over the cake, pushing most of it to the edge of the cake, leaving a small well in the middle. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the chocolate ganache into the well and top with another waffled cake. Repeat with remaining waffled cakes, raspberry cream and ganache, finishing with some raspberry cream on top. Decorate the top with the fresh raspberries and drizzle with the remaining ganache (microwave the ganache for a few seconds and stir if it needs to be loosened). If desired, dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
In a slow cooker, combine stock, tomatoes, beans, carrots, celery, onion, thyme, sage, bay leaves, and half a teaspoon each of salt and black pepper. Cover and cook on LOW for six to eight hours or on high for three to four hours.  Thirty minutes before the soup is done cooking, add ditalini, courgette and spinach. Cover and cook 30 more minutes. Remove bay leaves and season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle parmesan cheese over top. Garnish with basil, if desired.
